My name is Jorge Gallego Madrid and I am a recently graduated Computer Engineer at the University of Murcia (Spain), where I am currently M.S. student and research intern, with the firm objective of obtaining a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies.

The election of this area is motivated by my passion for information technologies. I am especially interested in the research fields of 5G, network slicing, Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced virtualization techniques. In my opinion, these areas will be of high interest for both academia and industry during the following years, as they are currently in their inception stages.
